## This website was made to showcase the books I own. 
### I plan to add 
- The numbers of my bookmarked pages

- Lightbox preview for the above features

### I might add
- Random book feature
- Categories w sort & filter
- 1 to 5 star rating

# This website was made using
Masonry for the css cascade, a javascript onload function to create the elements and a hashtable hold the book image link and amazon product link,
